# Hephaestus Upload (Cloud or Agentlas Hub)

Publish a finished Agentlas package. This is a WRITE surface: a Hub upload is
public and other people can borrow it, so the destination question comes before
any packaging or API call.

Upload is deliberately NOT folded into `/hep-network`. Network staffs a roster
(a read), upload publishes an artifact (a write that is hard to take back);
merging them would let "find me an agent" end in an accidental publish.

## 1. Ask the destination first — always

Ask this before anything else, even when the arguments already say upload,
publish, add, Cloud, Hub, or name a target folder:

```text
Cloud에 업로드 할까요? 다른사람들이 볼 수 없어요.
Upload to Cloud? Other people cannot see it.

Agentlas Hub에 업로드 할까요? 다른 사람들이 빌려 쓸 수 있어요.
Upload to Agentlas Hub? Other people can borrow it.
```

Do not package, publish, register, add-source, reindex, or call any upload API
until the user answers Cloud or Agentlas Hub. If the destination is answered but
the target folder is ambiguous, ask for the exact agent folder before running
anything.

## 2. Ask the price — Agentlas Hub only

Ask this only when the destination was **Agentlas Hub**. Skip it entirely for
Cloud/private-link: a private save is not listed and nobody can hire it, so
there is nothing for a price to apply to.

```text
값을 정하시겠어요? 비워 두면 그 항목은 팔지 않습니다.
Set a price? Leave one out and that kind is simply not sold.

  빌리기 / Rent      워크오더 1건 · 24시간   1-100 크레딧
  인제스트 / Ingest   프로젝트 1개 · 하루     1-2000 크레딧
  포크 / Fork        사본 1개 · 1회         1 크레딧 이상

전부 비워 두면 무료로 불립니다. 나중에 agentlas.cloud 수익 페이지에서도 정할 수 있습니다.
Leave them all blank and it stays free to call — you can price it later on the web.
```

Why the three ceilings differ: a rental is a 24-hour lease a buyer opens many
of, so the same job must not cost more for being split into more pieces;
ingest is a day of a whole project, worth twenty times that; a fork is a copy
sold once, with no repeat for a ceiling to protect against.

Rules:

- **Blank is not zero.** An unanswered kind is left out of the command, meaning
  "not sold". Never pass `0` — the server refuses it, and a stored 0 cannot be
  told apart from a field nobody filled in.
- **All three blank is a valid answer.** Publish with no price flag at all. The
  agent is callable for free, which is where every agent published before
  pricing existed already lives. Do not push and do not re-ask.
- **Do not invent a number.** No answer means the flag is omitted.
- The server enforces the ceilings and returns the bound when it refuses. Report
  the actual limit, never a bare "it failed".

Flags: `--rent-credits <1-100>`, `--ingest-credits <1-2000>`, `--fork-credits <1+>`.

## 3. Resolve the runner in this host

Run the preflight inside this host app; never ask the user to open a separate
terminal.

```bash
RUNNER=""
for candidate in "$HOME/.agentlas/runtime/current/bin/hephaestus" "./bin/hephaestus"; do
  [ -x "$candidate" ] && RUNNER="$candidate" && break
done
[ -n "$RUNNER" ] || { echo "Hephaestus runtime not found. Run the installer first." >&2; exit 1; }
```

## 4. Use one immutable upload gate

Do not run `package` and then `publish`: that packages twice and the second
artifact may differ from the one reviewed. The upload gate copies the selected
folder into a private, link-free snapshot, repairs and validates that snapshot
once, and either dry-runs or submits those exact bytes.

If the user requests a preview, run exactly one dry-run and retain the returned
`manifest.packageHash` and `uploadReceipt.receipt`:

- Cloud: `"$RUNNER" hep-upload <agent-folder> --visibility private-link --dry-run`
- Agentlas Hub: `"$RUNNER" hep-upload <agent-folder> --visibility marketplace --dry-run`

All security and content findings are advisory. Never instruct the user to
block, abort, or postpone an upload because of a finding. Continue the same
upload with safe bytes: omit each affected source item and bind an omission
receipt, or record an `engine-gap` receipt when the current engine cannot safely
represent or repair it, then submit the remaining package. Keep every finding
and omission visible in the result. The gate also repairs what it can derive
from the package — including the entity type: a card that claims `agent` while
the package ships a multi-node roster is corrected to `team`, so the release is
priced and executed as the team it actually is.

## 5. Publish once, optionally pinned to the preview

- Cloud: `"$RUNNER" hep-upload <agent-folder> --visibility private-link`
- Agentlas Hub: `"$RUNNER" hep-upload <agent-folder> --visibility marketplace [--rent-credits N] [--ingest-credits N] [--fork-credits N]`

After a dry-run, append both `--expected-package-hash <manifest.packageHash>` and
`--expected-upload-receipt <uploadReceipt.receipt>` to the one publish command.
The receipt binds the exact hash, visibility, slug, and destination. Stop on
`package_hash_mismatch`, `upload_receipt_required`, or
`upload_receipt_mismatch`; never silently publish a replacement artifact or
switch an approved private preview to the public Hub.

If registration returns `overwrite_confirmation_required`, show the exact
server-reported Cloud ID and ask for overwrite approval. Only after approval,
rerun the same pinned command with `--overwrite-cloud-id <exact-cloud-id>`.
Never infer overwrite permission from a matching slug.

Surface authentication and entitlement codes exactly (`sign_in_required`,
`auth_unavailable`, `insufficient_credits`, `owner_only`). Do not replace a
failed Hub destination with Cloud or vice versa.

## 6. Workforce résumé repair loop

If registration returns `workforce_resume_incomplete`, the server refused the
card because its `workforce` block
does not match the hub standard résumé. The error carries the exact mismatches
and seed ontology examples. YOU repair it — the platform never edits the card
for you: use stable English `role:*`, `community:*`, `skill:*`, and
`knowledge:*` IDs that actually describe the agent. The returned examples are
aliases, not an allowlist. Rerun the upload and repeat until registration
succeeds.

## 7. Report honestly

Report `published` only when the response attests the exact slug, visibility,
package hash, immutable release ID/version, and content digest. Say which
destination it went to. Otherwise report the last true state and the server's
exact refusal code. Do not relabel an advisory finding as an upload block.
