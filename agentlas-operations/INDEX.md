| `hephaestus_call` | Prepare explicitly named Agentlas Hub/cloud agents. |
| `hephaestus_network_status` | Report Hephaestus Network state: card counts, benchmark state, auto-routing gate. |
| `agentlas_authenticate` | Open the user's browser for a one-time Agentlas Google/sign-in flow, store the local signed-in state under ~/.agentlas/auth, and reuse it fo |

| `hephaestus_hub_invoke` | Prepare an exact Agentlas Hub public agent through the Hephaestus Network surface. |
| `workforce.preflight_work_order` | Compile a compact semantic staffing draft into an exact, privacy-checked agentlas.workforce-work-order.v1 and pin it locally behind a one-ho |
